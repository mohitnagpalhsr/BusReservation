Create a console application for booking a ticket for a bus.

Create Relevant Tables to implement the following features:

Customer Module:
1. Registration - to create an account to book tickets

3. Bus Availability Enquiry - This module will take details from user such as 
departure station, destination station, travelling date span, type of ticket 
(one way/return), return date (for return ticket), no of passengers. This 
detail will be compared with the bus database and return the user details 
of the available buses
4. Make Reservation - Based on the selected bus, user will be required to 
confirm booking by going through payment module. 
5 Cancel Reservation: A valid user of the application will be able to cancel 
any booked tickets with specified time. 
6. Print Ticket: Printing ticket facility should be provided in the application. 
7. Wallet payment: payment options should be added in the 
application to provide user flexibility of choosing suitable payment 
options.

Admin Module:
1. Update Route: Admin will have the option to update route of a 
bus. 
2. Add/Update Bus: Admin can add new bus and update existing 
bus details like number of seats, source, destinations etc.

Notes:
